# 8x Puzzle Solver using A* Algorithm
This project implements a solution to the 8x puzzle problem using the A* algorithm. It demonstrates how AI techniques can be applied to find the optimal sequence of moves from an initial puzzle configuration to the goal state.

# Problem Overview
The 8x puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 tiles, where one tile is missing, and the goal is to slide the tiles to reach a specific configuration. The A* algorithm is used to solve the puzzle efficiently by minimizing the cost of moves with the help of a heuristic function.

# How It Works
  - The A* algorithm is employed to explore the possible configurations of the puzzle.
  - A heuristic function guides the search by estimating the cost from the current state to the goal.
  - The program generates the sequence of moves that leads to the goal state.

# Features
  - Solves the 8x puzzle using the A* algorithm.
  - Displays the sequence of moves required to solve the puzzle.
  - Includes a heuristic to optimize the search process.
